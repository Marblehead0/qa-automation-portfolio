## üìå Overview
This is my end-to-end **QA Automation Portfolio** showcasing skills in API, Web, and CI/CD test automation.

It includes:
- ‚úÖ API tests with **pytest + requests**
- ‚úÖ Web tests with **Playwright + TypeScript** (Page Object Model)
- ‚úÖ Negative & positive test flows
- ‚úÖ CI/CD integration via **GitHub Actions**
- ‚úÖ Coverage reporting with pytest-cov

## üêû Debugging & Reports

### Playwright (Web)
- Run tests: `cd web-tests && npx playwright test`
- HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`
- Headed mode (see browser): `npx playwright test --headed`
- Debug mode (inspector): `npx playwright test --debug`
- Trace viewer (on retries): `npx playwright show-trace test-results/**/trace.zip`

Artifacts on failures:
- Screenshots (`only-on-failure`)
- Videos (`retain-on-failure`)
- Traces (`on-first-retry`)

### Pytest (API)
- With coverage + HTML report:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest api_tests --cov=api_tests --cov-report=term-missing \
    --html=api-report.html --self-contained-html

üìÇ Project Structure & Imports

This project uses TypeScript path aliases for clean, maintainable imports.
Instead of long relative paths (../../pages/LoginPage), we configure tsconfig.json with baseUrl + paths to support absolute imports.

Example (web-tests/tsconfig.json):

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "fixtures/*": ["fixtures/*"],
      "helpers/*": ["helpers/*"]
    }
  }
}


Before (relative imports):

import { LoginPage } from "../pages/LoginPage";
import { CREDS } from "../helpers/creds";


After (absolute imports):

import { LoginPage } from "pages/LoginPage";
import { CREDS } from "helpers/creds";


‚úÖ This ensures:

Cleaner code ‚Äî no fragile ../.. paths

Cross-platform reliability ‚Äî avoids case sensitivity issues in CI (Linux vs Windows)

Scalability ‚Äî easy to manage as the project grows
